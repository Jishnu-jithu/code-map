# CodePilot

CodePilot is an addon for Blender, inspired by the functionality of Pistiwique's [Pie Text Editor](https://github.com/pistiwique/pistiwique_pie_text_editor) addon, which has not been updated since Blender 2.79. While CodePilot is not a fork and is entirely different in its implementation, it maintains a similar user interface for familiarity.

This addon enhances your coding experience in Blender by providing a navigational interface for your code. It allows you to easily traverse through classes, methods, and functions, making your coding workflow smoother and more efficient.
