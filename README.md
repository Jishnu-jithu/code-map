# CodeMap

CodeMap is an addon for Blender, inspired by the functionality of [Pistiwique Pie Text Editor](https://github.com/pistiwique/pistiwique_pie_text_editor) addon, which has not been updated since Blender 2.79. While CodeMap is not a fork and is entirely different in its implementation, it maintains a similar user interface for familiarity.

This addon enhances your coding experience in Blender by providing a navigational interface for your code. It allows you to easily traverse through classes, methods, and functions, making your coding workflow smoother and more efficient.

## Popup
CodeMap includes a popup with the same features as the panel. The popup can be opened using the `` ` `` (backtick) shortcut key. This provides users with an alternative way to access the addon's functionality, offering flexibility based on individual preferences.
